# week5Lab

## Overview

This repository contains all materials for the Week 5 Lab, focusing on data cleaning, outlier detection, and basic data visualization using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
The primary notebook (`week5Lab.ipynb`) demonstrates techniques for working with real datasets and includes step-by-step explanations.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MandeepCon/Lab4-TCIO
cd week5Lab
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate on Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Or on Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `week5Lab.ipynb` to begin the lab.

## Contents

* `week5Lab.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook for the lab
* `requirements.txt` – Python packages required to run the notebook
* `.gitignore` – Lists files/folders not tracked by Git
* `Data/` – Folder containing raw data files (if applicable)

## Replicability Check

This notebook has been tested in a clean environment to ensure all code runs as expected when the required dependencies are installed (see the end of the notebook for details).
